<h4>Notes: </h4>

1. Used Bootstrap 4.0 beta

2. I did not implement the toggle navbar which is displayed when the screen size gets smaller than 768px
It seemed like too much work for something that is quite easily done in bootstrap.
I will come back to implement this fully after I am done with the Javascript section.

3. I did all implementation just as the example screen at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/jumbotron/
for screen size greater than 768px and most of it (except for the toggle navbar) for screens smaller
